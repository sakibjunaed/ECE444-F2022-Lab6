## Pros and Cons of TDD

Pros: 
Automation: Allows developers test features automatically without having to do each test manually, which can be time consuming and have errors
Quality of Code: You will be writing code to pass the tests, and this ensures that your code is functional and optimized
Prevent bugs: As you write small chunks of code you are constantly testing it. This is better than writing a big chunk and testing it all at the end and failing alot

Cons:
Slows down development: Planning and writing test cases is time consuming, taking time away from developers to make progress on implementing functionality
Performance: Running large amount of test cases can take alot of time and resources
Bad tests: Tests may not be rigrourous or contain bugs themselves, so just because your code passes the tests, it doesn't guarantee that it performs as expected.
